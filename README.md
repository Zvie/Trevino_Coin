# Trevino_Coin
To test go into a git bash command 

Type npm run test to run a normal test


To see the crypto and blockchain in action 

open a couple of terminals and 

in the Trevino_Coin Directory 

for the first terminal type npm run dev 

then in the second terminal you'll need to specify a new HTTP_PORT, new P2P_PORT, and check your PEERs 

PEERS will be equal to PEERS=ws://localhost:5001


to check the gets and posts, use Postman. 

Check the updates to come. 

For the GUI wallet and GUI miner I plan on using React.
